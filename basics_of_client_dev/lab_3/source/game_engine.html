		<p>Why would you want to write a game engine? There are many possible reasons:</p>
		<ul>
  			<li><p>You’re a tinkerer. You love building systems from the ground up and seeing them come to life.</p></li>
  			<li><p>You want to learn more about game development. I spent 14 years in the game industry and I’m still figuring it out. I wasn’t even sure I could write an engine from scratch, since it’s vastly different from the daily responsibilities of a programming job at a big studio. I wanted to find out.</p></li>
  			<li><p>You like control. It’s satisfying to organize the code exactly the way you want, knowing where everything is at all times.</p></li>
  			<li><p>You feel inspired by classic game engines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Game_Interpreter">AGI</a> (1984), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_engine">id Tech 1</a> (1993), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_(game_engine)">Build</a> (1995), and industry giants like Unity and Unreal.</p></li>
  			<li><p>You believe that we, the game industry, should try to demystify the engine development process. It’s not like we’ve mastered the art of making games. Far from it! The more we examine this process, the greater our chances of improving upon it.</p></li>
