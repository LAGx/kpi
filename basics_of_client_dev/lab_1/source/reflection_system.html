	<H1 class="title">What is reflection?</H1>

	<div class="body_article">
		<p class="article_text">In this post, I’ll present a small, flexible system for runtime reflection using C++11 language features. This is a system to generate metadata for C++ types. The metadata takes the form of TypeDescriptor objects, created at runtime, that describe the structure of other runtime objects.</p>
		<p class="article_text">I’ll call these objects type descriptors. My initial motivation for writing a reflection system was to support serialization in my custom C++ game engine, since I have very specific needs. Once that worked, I began to use runtime reflection for other engine features, too:</p>
		<p class="article_text">This reflection system is based on preprocessor macros and templates. C++, at least in its current form, was not designed to make runtime reflection easy. As anyone who’s written one knows, it’s tough to design a reflection system that’s easy to use, easily extended, and that actually works. I was burned many times by obscure language rules, order-of-initialization bugs and corner cases before settling on the system I have today.</p>
